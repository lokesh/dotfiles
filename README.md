MacOS uses zsh shell by default.

## Terminal

- Install nvm
- Install node through nvm: `nvm install node`

### Oh My ZSH

Configuration:

- .zprofile
  - loads .profile
  - loads .zshrc

## Github
- Set up git username/email
- Run `generate_ssh_keys.sh`.
- (Optional) Run `clone_github_repos.sh` to clone all your Github repos and put them in `~/Projects/`.

## MacOS apps
- Install **Xcode** and agree to license
- **Rectangle** for Window mgmt. Shortcuts to full screen, 50/50, 1/3, 2/3, et al. Previously used Spectacles, but it is no longer maintained.
- **Lunar** for managing multi-monitor brightness. Set up left-half, right half, max, and centering shortcuts, and enable cycling sizes so repeating the left and right half shortcuts will move between 1/3, 1/2, and 2/3.
- **Eagle** for collecting inspiration (images and video).
